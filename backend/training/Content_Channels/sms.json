  "transcript": "In addition to sending emails, the application also allows you to send SMS text messages. So if we look in create SMS, setting one of these SMS broadcasts up is pretty straightforward. So I have to give my broadcast a title. If I intend to have a clickable link in the text message then I can put that in this field. Here I can type out the message I intend to send and wherever I want to insert. This link I'll use the tag SMS link. Once those are filled out, you can hit next. On this page you'll decide a few settings here, so do you want to send to US and Canada recipients only? Do you want to include all countries with the US and Canada or all countries minus the US and Canada? Then you will send to your normal lists that you use for e-mail broadcast. So I'm going to send to this employees list. And hit next. And then the broadcast page tells me how many folks on that list are opted in. Potentially, how many are opted out and then I can start now or schedule with a date and time picker. Once I've chosen a time, I can schedule, and we'll see this status page here telling me it's currently scheduled the date and time that it will send, how many SMS messages it will send, and once it has sent, you can come back to this reporting tab to see how many mails or how many messages were sent, how many clicks there were and other data points. The SMS feature does require some additional setup, so if you're interested in sending SMS messages, reach out to your customer success manager who can help out.",
