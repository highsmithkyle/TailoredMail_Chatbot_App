  "transcript": "Creating an e-mail can be quite straightforward. To get started, we'll go to create project. And the first decision we have to make is inside which of our project folders should we create our new mail. I'll be creating a new weekly newsletter. Once I'm inside my folder. There are two options I can start from scratch with the new addition button in the top right or I can choose one of my previously created mails and use the copy option. We'll be starting from scratch. The first thing I have to do is give it a name and hit create. Once I've created the new addition, it will take me into the design tab so you can see across the top. I have design, test, broadcast and reports (Tabs within the Interface). Design is where we will build all of our content for our main. Down here in the view, we can see my template or the wrapper around my content is already sitting there and waiting and to start putting content into my template I'm going to add a content block. The first. The thing I need to do is give it a name. I'll name mine content and then choose a layout. So this is just what I want. A single column or two half 5050 columns or three and so on. Once I've chosen my layout, I can see on the right hand side all of the drag and drop components I have available to me. There are a few different sets, snippets being the simplest, they are just independent single element. So just. A title or just a button. There are also articles which are more full-fledged. So it's got a title and an image and a button and it's aligned nicely for you. There are also tables if you need to display tabular data in your e-mail and then the dynamic. That's all of the dynamic, embeddable, elements, so videos and countdown clocks and things like that. As you saw. I can choose whichever component I like, I drag and drop once and I've dragged them in, I can just click into each element and start editing. I can change my title to and there are a lot of the text editing functionality that you're already used to. You can use those here as well, so things like copy and paste, copy, cut and paste. Bold, Italicize, underline, all of that. When you're inside of a text element, you'll see a bar appear up top that gives you some other things. So left align, center align, right align. Add a bulleted list, add a numbered list, things like that. For images, You can click an image and on the right hand side will pop up settings for that image. Things like, do I want it to be mobile responsive? Do I want to link that image somewhere? Most important is this top section here. So when you are sending your mail, you won't be wanting to send with this placeholder image you want to put in your own image. This little dot dot dot will allow you to swap in your own image. That opens the chooser and inside of the chooser in the images directory we can find all of the images we've stored for use and you can choose the image you want and hit choose and you can see it's inserted my image for me. For buttons. Similarly, click the button, click the button you get settings on the right so. I want my button to say read more and then link it where it needs to Go. You can, if you've accidentally added too many or not the right type of component you can click the trash can to make them go away. Other style options can be found in the settings wheel. And if I open that every element of my component here will be shown on the right and I can open up each of these to adjust style settings for particular elements. So maybe I want to change my button background color. There's a section here called button style and I can open that and I get background color and border radius. So perhaps I want a dark blue button rather than black. I can choose my color hit OK and now. My button is blue. Once you're done building your content. Be sure to save. And once it saves that pop up window closes and we can go, it takes us back to the design tab and we can see here's my template, but now the content block that I just edited is displayed for me inside that template.",
