  "transcript": "In addition to sending e-mail, the application will allow you to also build microsites. You can think of a microsite as a little small website, or maybe as an a replacement for something like SharePoint. So you can create posts, link all the posts together and build essentially a little website so and create micro site. You can see I have, one microsite here and inside there's lots of settings to adjust, but at its most basic, you make a post and that is one contained unit of news or information and then you can make a lot of posts categorize them, link them together just like you would, In a website. So, I've got a bunch of posts here. If I look inside of one, I can see I can build a teaser so a little quick blurb about what's the content of this post. I can then put in the full post content inside that and this builder is very similar to our e-mail builder, so it's all drag and drop based. We support in the micro sites the dynamic targeting just like we do in e-mail. So you can say some of these people can access this content and some others can't and then you can even set up sharing with. Social social media platforms or things like teams and slack and Yammer, things like that. So once you put all this together, it can look potentially something like this. So we've got a little help micro site you can see up top some announcements. Over on the right, we have recent posts and then as we break Scroll down, we can see these categories of updates and. Tips. Creating emails and templates. How to manage your lists and segments and here are those. Teasers. And then I can drill down to see more about uploading your list. The micro sites can be hosted through pros. They can also be embedded into a SharePoint site or embedded into Salesforce. And we have lots of options for securing them so that only the people you want to grant access to can access this information. Setting up the microsite does take a little bit of help from your customer success manager, so if a microsite seems like something you might be interested in, reach out to them and they can give you a hand.",
