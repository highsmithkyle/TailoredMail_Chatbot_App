  "transcript": "Now I've set my test and it looks great, I'm ready to send a broadcast. So stepping right from the tests tab, we'll step into broadcast tab. There's several pages throughout the broadcasting process and very often it's just checking your work to make sure everything looks good and everything's going to be sent the way you expect it to. This very first page is mostly checking the from information what's the from name, the from address, reply to address, subject line and preview message. If all of those first five fields there look correct, then you're ready to go on to Step 2. The second page, which we call the broadcast criteria page is. Well, I've got my firm information, but who am I sending this mail to? There's several options here. The most straightforward to understand is sent to all, and that's just what it says. Every subscriber in your account will get this mail. Define custom criteria is a little more targeted than that, so perhaps I want to send to a specific list that I've built or just a specific department and my company or just the Seattle office? Things like that. The third option is this e-mail paste create list option here. So here let's say you just have a big pile of addresses somebody sent to you. You can take those, paste them all into this box, save and include or exclude and send mail to those folks. So for this example, I'm going to send to this dynamic list I've created of employees, so I'm going to highlight that and I just want to put it into the include criteria so into the green box so, only the people on this list are included in the broadcast, so those folks will get the mail. I could also combine that with some excludes, so maybe I want to send to employees but get rid of all the C-Suite folks so we can combine these together to more fully target exactly who we want to receive. For now, we'll keep it simple and send to my list of employees. So we can hit continue this step is. Again, kind of check your work page so the from information again the subject line. Again you can look at a preview of your mail content again just to make sure it looks good. And now that we've given it a list or a segment that we want to send to, it tells us how many people we are expecting to send. So it says there's 10 people on that list, and if I drill into this 10, it will actually list out those addresses for me so I can double check that yes, The people I expected on that list are the people on that list. And if that looks good then, we can step in to schedule. On the scheduling page, we have a couple options. Either start now and if I leave that selected and click start now, it will do just that. Start sending mail out the door right now. I also can, choose schedule and I get a date and time picker. Note. I happen to be on the West Coast, so I schedule a Pacific Time. You will schedule and whatever your local time is. So just keep that in mind in the top right. Again, we get kind of a check your work section. So how many people are we sending this to the from name the from address, the subject line, and a little thumbnail preview of the e-mail we're about to send. You can click it to see it in full size again if you'd like to. And there's also some options down below, so one of the most common is I want to go ahead and set up a resend to anybody who doesn't open this X days after maybe, so I can say three days later, send it again to anybody who didn't open it and maybe I changed the subject line. There's also send an SMS message to anybody who didn't open or click, so it's very similar, but instead of resending the e-mail, we're going to send them a text. And then, repeat this full broadcast. Let's resend it to everybody after a certain period of time, no matter whether they opened it or not. There's also we can set up automated reports to come directly to your inbox 24 hours or anytime period after the broadcast. Once you've picked the date and time for your send. You can hit schedule and the last thing you'll see here is the broadcast or the send status page that gives us information about our scheduled broadcast so I can see information about who set it up. The subject line where it is inside of the application, If I need to go find it. So it's in the weekly newsletter folder and the name of the e-mail is 15 May 2023. The date and time is scheduled to send its current status, how many mails it will send and then there's actions where If I need to change the schedule,or cancel it.",
